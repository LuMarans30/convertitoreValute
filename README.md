# convertitoreValute

Another version of this [app](https://github.com/LuMarans30/currencyExchangeMAUI) that calculates the currency exchange between two currencies.
The exchange rates are updated by sending an HTTP request to the European Commission webservice, which sends back a JSON file containing all the monthly updated exchange rates for each country in the world.
This website is made in Preact with vite and mui.
